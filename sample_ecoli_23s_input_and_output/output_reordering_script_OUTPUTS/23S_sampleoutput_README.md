Note the classification of a 'm3U or m1acp3Y' at position 1915. This is actually a m3pseu modification, not found in any of our training sets. Thus, this classification has not been included in our results set. This is an example of our method being used to detect new kinds of modifications that are not originally in our training set, but that generate mutational profiles that are similar to those of other modified sites.
